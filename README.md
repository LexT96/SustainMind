## Background

In the summer semester of 2023, our team participated in a significant challenge aimed at addressing a pressing issue in the business world. The challenge focused on empowering small and middle-sized enterprises (SMEs) to navigate the complex landscape of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) regulations. This challenge presented an opportunity to develop a solution that could revolutionize how SMEs approach sustainability and responsible business practices.

Our team, consisting of students from various disciplines, was excited to take on this task and create a meaningful impact. We named our software solution "SustainMind" - a cloud-based supply chain software designed to help corporations analyze their supply chains, identify risks, and collaborate on implementing ESG compliance measures.

## Competitor Analysis

A lot of companies currently use excel tables to identify risks and to manage prevention measures, which is very time consuming and error prone. Existing software solutions for supply chain compliance are often only targeted towards larger companies. Our software, on the other hand, also targets medium sized companies. Furthermore, we are the only company that allows collaboration with other companies who have the same suppliers to jointly conduct prevention measures and to share costs. We furthermore generate sustainability certificates to prove supply chain sustainability to customers.

## Pricing

Our Sustainmind pricing model offers flexibility and scalability to meet the different needs of companies. The basic fee is 40,000 euros and already includes 100 suppliers. In addition, we offer a discount to small companies to help them get started.For an additional 50 suppliers beyond the included 100, there is a fee of 15,000 euros. This allows companies to expand their supplier network and extend a comprehensive risk analysis to a larger number of partners. In addition, we offer the option of an on-site audit, where we review various items to ensure that all relevant specifications and standards are met. We charge a separate fee of 500 euros for this audit. It ensures that companies receive a thorough review and can further strengthen their compliance efforts.
